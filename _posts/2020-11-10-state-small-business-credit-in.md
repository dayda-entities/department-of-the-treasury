The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)Transactions Dataset is a set of files reporting transaction level data for all transactions conducted through the SSBCI program from inception in 2011 through December 31, 2016. This dataset categorizes transactions by program type, according to the five approved SSBCI programs: Capital Access Programs, Collateral Support Programs, Loan Guarantee Programs, Loan Participation Programs, and Venture Capital Programs. The transaction level data was reported to Treasury by Participating States on an annual basis, as required by the Allocation Agreements. Participating States included all 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data fields provided here include the total financing amount, the amount of federal dollars expended, the date of the transaction, and the industry, zip code, and FTEs of the business receiving financing at the point of transaction, among other fields. The data files are available for public use. This dataset provides quantitative information that can be used for analysis of federal expenditure in supporting small business and economic development in identifying how and where federal financing was used.
